# Andy Everall's portfolio

This will be regularly updated and improved as I learn more about building websites. 


## Upcoming improvements:

### Build postfolio website to be accessed from andyeverall.github.io
### Create self profile with pictures, links to cv/documents, description of my interests
### Include links to pages which are projects as a part of my training course with Udacity
### Develop some pages with information about my Astrophysics work


I'm constantly learning about this so if you're interested and want to give me some advice on best practices and improvements, I'm always interested.
